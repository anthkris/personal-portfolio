# K. Anthony Portfolio Site

This site was originally ported over from WordPress and is build on Gatsby JS.

The previous base design was taken from the MIT licensed portfolio of James Ciclitira: https://github.com/james-ciclitira/portfolio-site

In 2021, I completely redesigned the site to better reflect the work I want to do in the world.
